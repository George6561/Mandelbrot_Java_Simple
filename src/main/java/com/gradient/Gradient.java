/**
 * Abstract base class representing a sparse definition of a color gradient.
 * <p>
 * This class stores a set of discrete color nodes indexed between 0.0 and 1.0,
 * which serve as anchors in a conceptual continuous gradient. Concrete subclasses
 * of {@code Gradient} must implement the {@link #process(double)} method to define
 * how to interpolate between these nodes and compute the resulting color at any
 * intermediate point.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This design avoids storing an entire continuous gradient in memory. Instead,
 * it provides a flexible, on-demand way of generating colors using various interpolation
 * strategies. Color nodes can be dynamically added and removed, and optimized caching is
 * employed to avoid recomputation where possible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To function correctly, the gradient must have defined colors at both ends
 * (0.0 and 1.0). Otherwise, interpolation is undefined and {@code GradientException}
 * will be thrown.
 * </p>
