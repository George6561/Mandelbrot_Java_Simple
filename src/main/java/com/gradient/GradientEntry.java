/**
 * Represents a single, immutable color node within a continuous color gradient.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code GradientEntry} instance stores a specific ARGB color value and its
 * associated normalized position in the gradient, ranging from 0.0 (start) to 1.0 (end).
 * Gradient entries are intended to act as fixed reference points from which interpolated
 * color values can be computed in {@link Gradient} implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link Comparable}, allowing gradient entries to be sorted
 * by their index position. Factory methods are provided for convenience to create
 * start, end, or arbitrary-position entries.
