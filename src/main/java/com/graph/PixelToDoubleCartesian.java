/**
 * Converts image-space coordinates to their equivalent positions in the Cartesian plane
 * using double-precision arithmetic.
 * <p>
 * This class enables the mapping of pixel locations (represented as {@code double}s)
 * to Cartesian coordinates for use in high-precision graphical applications, such as
 * fractal rendering. It supports various construction methods based on plane bounds,
 * center points, or magnification factors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable and tailored to specific image dimensions and
 * scaling ratios. The use of double precision allows sub-pixel accuracy, making it
 * suitable for applications requiring anti-aliasing or smooth zooming.
