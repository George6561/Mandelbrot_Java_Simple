/**
 * Utility class for working with ARGB and RGB color values.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive set of predefined color constants with their
 * ARGB values, closely matching the W3C color names used in web and desktop development.
 * It also includes methods for constructing ARGB/RGB values from individual color components,
 * extracting individual components from packed int values, and converting those values to human-readable strings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Designed to facilitate color manipulation and conversion in graphical applications,
 * user interfaces, and other visual tools requiring programmatic color handling.
