 * configuration. The input and output objects support additional metadata for
 * advanced rendering tasks, such as coloring and escape detection analysis.

 * Implementations of this interface can vary in precision, optimization strategy,
 * or feature support (e.g., cardioid/bulb detection, periodicity checking).

 * @param <T> The type used to represent coordinates in the complex plane (e.g., Double, BigDecimal).
